## Welcome to Ubuntu!
### Introduction
[Ubuntu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5yM4ZYwB_s) is a free and open-source operating system based on Linux. It is maintained by Canonical Ltd. and the community of developers. Ubuntu is designed to be user-friendly, secure, and adaptable, making it a popular choice for desktops, servers, and even cloud computing.

### Download an Ubuntu Image
**What you’ll learn**   
In this tutorial, we will guide you through the steps required to install Ubuntu Desktop on your laptop or PC.

**What you’ll need**
- A laptop or PC with at least 25GB of storage space.
- A flash drive (12GB or above recommended).

For this tutorial, we will use the latest Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish). You can download an mirror Ubuntu image [here](https://mirror.twds.com.tw/ubuntu-releases/). Make sure to save it to a memorable location on your PC!

### Create a Bootable USB stick
To install Ubuntu Desktop, you need to write your downloaded ISO to a USB stick to create the installation media. This is not the same as copying the ISO, and requires some bespoke software.  

For this tutorial, we’ll use [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/#download-etcher), as it runs on Linux, Windows and Mac OS. Choose the version that corresponds to your current operating system, download and install the tool.

Select your downloaded ISO, choose your USB flash drive, and then click **Flash**! to install your image.

### Boot from USB flash drive
Insert the USB flash drive into the laptop or PC you want to use to install Ubuntu and boot or restart the device. It should recognise the installation media automatically. If not, try holding `DELETE` during startup and selecting the USB device from the system-specific boot menu.

Whilst Ubuntu works on a wide range of devices, it is recommended that you use a device listed on the [Ubuntu certified hardware](https://ubuntu.com/certified?q=&category=Laptop&category=Desktop&limit=20) page. These devices have been tested and confirmed to work well with Ubuntu.
