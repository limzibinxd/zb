## Step 1: Download an Image of Ubuntu

## Step 2: Create a Bootable USB Drive
We cannot just copy the ISO file, we need a software to write ISO images to USB drives so that it is bootable. In this case, we will use [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) to write our downloaded ISO to a USB drive to create an installation media.

Select the version that corresponds to your operating system and click download.

Open **balenaEtcher**, select the ISO file that you have downloaded, select the target USB drive and hit **"Flash!"**. This process may take a while to finish.  

## Step 3: Boot Up from USB Drive
Insert the USB drive into the laptop or PC you want to install Ubuntu and boot or restart it. If it does not recognize the installation media automatically, restart the device and repeatedly press `F12` or `del` on your keyboard to enter BIOS.

## Step 4: Installation Setup
Different Ubuntu versions have varying installation interfaces. Generally, you can follow the on-screen installation wizard to select your installation type, create a username and login credentials, set keyboard and language preferences, choose a region, and so on. Once these steps are complete, click **Install** to begin the installation process.
