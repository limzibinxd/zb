# 1-7 Deployment of Docusaurus

**Deploying Docusaurus** means making your website live on the internet. After creating your documentation site, you upload it to a hosting service like GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, or a private server. This lets others access your site online. Itâ€™s like publishing a book, but on the web!

In this short tutorial, we will learn how to deploy our Docusaurus website so that it is accessible to users on the Internet.

## Step 1: Edit `docusaurus.config.js` File

Edit the following parameters:

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
const config = {
  ...

  url: 'https://your-github-username.github.io',
  baseUrl: '/your-repo/',

  organizationName: 'your-github-username',
  projectName: 'your-repo',

  ...
  }
```

## Step 2: Deploy

In `workspaces/username/my-website`, run the following command:

```bash
GIT_USER=your-github-username yarn deploy
```

:::warning

Please ensure that you have your GitHub credentials configured before deploying!
