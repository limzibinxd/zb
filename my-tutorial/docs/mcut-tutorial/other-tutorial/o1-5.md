## Step 1: Install USB/IP Tools
**On Windows ü™ü**(Host) : 

Open **Command Prompt** as Administrator, run the following command to install `usbipd`:

```bash
winget install usbipd
```

**On Linux üêß**(Client) :

Open a terminal, install `usbip` and required kernel module using:

```bash
sudo apt install usbip
sudo modprobe vhci-hcd
```

:::info
‚úÖ usbipd allows sharing USB devices from Windows.  
‚úÖ usbip and vhci-hcd let Linux receive and use those devices.
:::

## Step 2: Check & Bind the USB Device (on Windows Host)
List all connected USB devices

```bash
usbipd list
```

Example output:
```yaml
BUSID  VID:PID    DEVICE
1-3    0951:1666  Kingston USB Device
```

Bind the USB device

```bash
usbipd bind --busid=1-3
```

## Step 3: Attach the USB Device (on Linux Client)
list the available shared devices from the host

```bash
sudo usbip list -r <HOST_IP>
```

Example output:

```yaml
Exportable USB devices
 - 1-3: Kingston USB Device [0951:1666]
```

Attach the shared device to the Linux system

```bash
sudo usbip attach -r <HOST_IP> -b 1-3
```

After attaching, the device will appear as a local USB device.

## Step 4: Transfer files to the USB device
Check if the USB device is detected

```bash
lsblk
```

You should see a new device

`/dev/sda` or `/dev/sdb`

Write an image file to USB devices

```bash
sudo bmaptool copy yourimage.bmap /dev/sdb
```

You‚Äôve successfully shared a USB device from your Windows host to your Linux VM using USB/IP and usbipd-win!
