## Step 1: Open Qt Creator

Open Qt Creator by using this command

```bash title="Open a terminal window, input the commands,"
unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH
source /opt/poky/3.1.31/environment-setup-aarch64-poky-linux
```

```bash title="Run Qtcreator ( Qt5.6.3 )"
cd ~/Qt5.6.3/Tools/QtCreator/bin/
./qtcreator
```

## Step 3: Build Default Control Application

1. Click `Design`, Qt will switch to Design mode immediately. Under Design mode, we can drag the objects like buttons, or drag the contols from the left side to the center canvas. You also can click on anyone of the control list, then set it's properties on the right-hand side.

2. Modify the code of Btn.qml to

```bash 
import QtQuick 2.5
import QtQuick.Controls 1.4
import QtQuick.Layouts 1.2
        Button {
            width: 100
            height: 50
            id: button1
            text: qsTr("Hello")
            }
```

3. Add the code to `ApplicationWindow { }` in main.qml

```bash 
Btn {
    x:100
    y:100
}
```

4. Click on `Run` button in the lower left corner, the 'Hello' Button is created.
